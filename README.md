Created 4 notebooks given as follows: 
  1. **Notebook 1:** Implemented only the Spatial Network on UCF11  
  2. **Notebook 2:** Implemented the Three-Stream Network using 3D CNN on UCF11   
  3. **Notebook 3:** Implemented the Three-Stream Network using 2D CNN on UCF11 
  4. **Notebook 4:** Implemented the Three-Stream Network using 2D CNN and performed 10-fold cross-validation on UCF11

Implemented the following architecture
